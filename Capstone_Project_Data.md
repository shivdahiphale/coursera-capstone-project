## Capstone Project Data Description

To solve our problem we need data which is propely maintained and stored and uptodate. And that data should be easly accessible.
For that we are going to use **Foursquare** APIs.

Foursqaure API data is easily available and which contains all the information required to build our application. Following data can be fetched from Foursquare APIs.
1. Vennues data
2. Places tips povided by Users
3. User Profiles

### 1. Vennue Data
Our Vennue data contains Name, address, latitude, longitude, City, Vennue category etc. information. Sample table structure of our data will looks like below image.

### 2. Tips Data
For specific Vennue or place we can see tips provided by other users. 

### 3. User Profile
User profile contains basic user information with all the tips he/she has provided for places.

From above raw data we can solve our problem. Our Application will group data of places by nearby places and find out the similar places and categories places with similarity features.
